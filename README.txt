semidiscrete
============

Python bindings for the semidiscrete RT model of Gobron et al.

Note this version includes adjoint code developed by N Gobron, T Kaminski, 
P Lewis and J Gomez-Dans derived from the original NADIM/semidiscrete. These
modifications were funded by the ESA `EOLDAS <http://www.assimila.eu/eoldas>`_
project.

The original semidiscrete code can be found `here <http://fapar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/WWW/Data/Pages/FAPAR_Software/FAPAR_Software_RTModels_1-2Discrete.php>`_
